Hey! Thanks for you contribution. To help you with that pull request,
we have here some useful informations for you.

Did you know:
  - Our development happens on `next` branch. So should yours. Please
    ensure your base is `next`. More information [here](https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k/wiki/Developer's-Guide).
  - We have a lot of unit tests (in `test` dir). It would be awesome,
    if you would add one for your feature.
  - For manual tests there are Vagrant files and Docker files prepared.
    Just have a look at the [test readme](https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k/blob/next/TESTS.md)
  - Our [wiki](https://github.com/bhilburn/powerlevel9k/wiki) is quite
    packed with loads of information about how to configure this theme.
    If your feature has some flexpoint, the configuration help should
    probably go there or in the README.
